## Problem Statement:
To provide valuable insights in making informed decisions about business strategize, and understand the dynamics of sales and order patterns. 
Vrinda Garments wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, Vrinda Store can understand its customers and grow more sales in 2023.

## Objective:

learn how data analysis is done using MS Excel, creating a dashboard that helps in better decision-making.

## Insights:
* Highest number of sales and orders were recorded in March.
* Women are more inclined to buy things than men (64%).
* Orders based on age vs gender show Sets and Kurtas are the highest-selling 
  categories.
* The top three states include Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.
* Adults aged 30-49 years have contributed to maximum sales.
* 80% of orders are made through the Amazon platform.
